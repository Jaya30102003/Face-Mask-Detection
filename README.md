# Face-Mask-Detection
This project is a deep learning-based face mask detection system that classifies images into two categories:
- with_mask
- without_mask
The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras and trained on a dataset of masked and unmasked faces.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Automatic detection of face masks from images.
- Preprocessing steps including resizing, normalization, and label encoding.
- CNN-based model trained using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Model evaluation with accuracy metrics.
- 
## ðŸ§  Model Architecture
- Conv2D Layers : Extract image features.
- MaxPooling2D Layers : Reduce dimensionality.
- Flatten Layer : Convert feature maps to 1D.
- Dense Layers : Fully connected neural network.
- Dropout Layers : Reduce overfitting.
- Output Layer : Sigmoid activation for binary classification.
